"""
Shall contain code that enhances the data as part of the preprocessing step
before handing it over to the actual templating code. It works by introducing
an internal (enhanced) model of the API model.

    ? I feel like the way the enhancement is applied is ugly. But I can't think
    ? of a better way to do it with Pydantic. I guess I could convert the whole
    ? tree into a Box and be done with Pydantic but I'd rather not.

    Technical info: What this function does is really simple, but it is done in
    a quite convuluted way due to features / limits in Pydantic. It is not
    possible to add attributes to a Pydantic model instance. Therefore another
    set of models has been created. So the base models are turned into dicts,
    mutated and then converted into the new models. This has to be done in
    layers because `construct` does not work with nested models.

        ? more enhancements. But for now it works fine.
